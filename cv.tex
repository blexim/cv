%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Document Setup %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Don't like 10pt? Try 11pt or 12pt
\documentclass[10pt]{article}

% This is a helpful package that puts math inside length specifications
\usepackage{calc}

% Layout: Puts the section titles on left side of page
\reversemarginpar

%
%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines
% below.
%

%% Use these lines for letter-sized paper
\usepackage[paper=letterpaper,

%            includemp]{geometry}

%% More layout: Get rid of indenting throughout entire document
\setlength{\parindent}{0in}

%% This gives us fun enumeration environments. compactitem will be nice.
\usepackage{paralist}

%% Reference the last page in the page number
%
% NOTE: comment the +LP line and uncomment the -LP line to have page
%       numbers without the ``of ##'' last page reference)
%
% NOTE: uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} line to get rid of all page
%       numbers (make sure includefoot is commented out above)

\usepackage{fancyhdr,lastpage}

\section{About Me}
I am a computer scientist.  My main work-related interests are program analysis and security,
with a particular focus on application security.  I have a long track record
of building very high quality software, ranging in scope from highly reliable, distributed
servers, through mobile client applications, to state of the art software model checkers.

		I am currently studying for a PhD in the software verification group.  My

		techniques and tools to analyse C programs and create exploits for them. This
		involves working a lot with decision procedures, software model checkers and binary
		analysis.

I worked in the mobile group writing client-side and server-side Java and C++, as
well as several Google-specific languages. I also did a lot of server administration in
this role, including being on-call for two reasonable sized services. For the last six
months or so, I was the tech lead for a small team.

As a 20\% project, I spent some time doing a security audit of the open source project
SVN and discovered a couple of serious vulnerabilities which affected around a million
open source projects. I then worked with the SVN and Apache teams to fix the problems
and roll out the patch.

        I spent a summer doing research with the Security Group.  We analysed a widely used, commercial wireless sensor network system, and discovered several vulnerabilities.
        Our results were published at ACNS.  This work involved, among other things, writing assembly language for the microcontrollers on ``smart dust'' sensors

	 I designed and wrote a fairly complex network security scanner in a combination of C

	 programmers when I left for university in October 2005.  I continued to work on the project part-time,
	 but primarily in a system design capacity.
	 
	 I was also involved in other aspects of the company's work, including penetration testing and
	 bespoke programming for financial clients.

\section{Technical Skills}
I am proficient in procedural, functional, object oriented, declarative and assembly languages.
The languages I have most experience with are C, C++, Python and Java.  I have also written
fairly large programs (around 10k lines) in F$\sharp$ and OCaml.

I have a lot of experience with application security assessment, and am also reasonably proficient
at network-level and host-level security assessment.  

\section{Open Source Projects}
I am one of the main contributors to the \href{http://www.cprover.org/cbmc/}{\sc CBMC} and
\href{http://www.cprover.org/svn/wolverine/trunk/}{\sc Wolverine} model checkers,
as well as the \href{http://www.cprover.org/kalashnikov/}{\sc Kalashnikov} program synthesiser.
